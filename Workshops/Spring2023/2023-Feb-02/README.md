## Network Visualization in R
Description:
Describing networks is virtually impossible without plotting them. Fortunately, the R programming language hosts several packages that plot networks from data frames, tables, or matrices. Unfortunately, there can be incompatibilities between packages. 

In this session of Data Science Tapas, we will create and describe network objects `igraph` and plot these networks using `ggraph` which utilizes the `ggplot2` framework.
