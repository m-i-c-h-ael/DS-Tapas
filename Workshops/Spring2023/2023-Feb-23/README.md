## Simulating Data for Study Design in R

Description: Simulating data is a powerful tool towards study design. In particular, simulated data can allow one to run a-priori statistical power analyses to understand what sample size is needed to detect different effect sizes.

In this session of Data Science Tapas, we will simulate data using the `simstudy` framework in R. A future session will go over statistical power analysis.
