## Statistical Power Analysis in R
**Description**: A priori power analysis is an essential tool towards study design, as it allows you to determine, for example, sample sizes required to detect a significant effect at different effect sizes. 

In this session of Data Science Tapas, we will go over simple (ANOVA) power analysis with the `pwr` package and complex (LMER) power analysis, simulations with the `simr` package. 

This workshop is based on materials from [Ladal](https://ladal.edu.au/index.html), found [here](https://ladal.edu.au/pwr.html)
