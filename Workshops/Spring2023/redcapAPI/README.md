## REDCap to R Markdown, reproducibly

#### Description:

REDCap is an electronic data capture software that is widely used in the academic research community. You can interact with REDCap's API from an R environment. Interaction with an R environment allows us to increase the reproducibility of our reports in R Markdown. 

In this session of Data Science Tapas, we will explore how to go from REDCap to reproducible R Markdown reports through R packages and the REDCap API. 

#### Take Away

`rmarkdownReport.rmd` is an example clinical study report that can be edited with your credentials for your own REDCap reporting.
